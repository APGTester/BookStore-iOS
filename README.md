Setup Steps:

1. Download the following iOS app as a zip file to your local machine.  (Note: This is a sample ios BookStore application)
2. Open the xcode project file within the XCode IDE and Build for Testing using Product | Build For | Testing.
3. Run the application first and click/tap through it to get an idea of the general functionality.  It is a pretty basic application i.e. Searching for technical books, Selecting a Book etc.

Challenge:

Given the Bookstore iOS app, you will need to setup and add XCUITests to test 3 simple test cases of your choosing.

XCUITest is a UI test tool built into XCode and is the tool we use to automate against several of our mobile Applications.  

We are not looking for a perfect solution but for you to demonstrate the ability to learn a new technology and to have an example we can use to discuss in the interview.
 
Note: This is an open book test. Use whatever online resources you need to complete the task.
